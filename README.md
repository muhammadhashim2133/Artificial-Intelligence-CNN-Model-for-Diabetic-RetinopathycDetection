# Deep Computer Vision for Diabetic Retinopathy Detection CNN Model

In this guide, we'll explore the application of deep computer vision through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification and object detection/recognition. Specifically, we aim to identify signs of diabetic retinopathy in eye images, leveraging the power of neural networks.

## CNN Components

### 1. Image Data

Our input features consist of retinal images, either in grayscale or RGB format. It's essential to normalize pixel values between 0 and 1 before feeding them into the model.

### 2. Convolutional Layer

The convolutional layer applies filters to the input image, creating feature maps that help classify the image. Multiple filters are used to extract various features. The convolution operation involves sliding the filter over the image, multiplying pixel values, and summing them up to generate a feature map.

### 3. Pooling Layer

After convolution, the pooling layer reduces the dimensions of the feature map, preserving essential information and speeding up computation. Max pooling and average pooling are common techniques. They involve taking the maximum or average values from highlighted areas, respectively.

### 4. Fully Connected Layer

The fully connected layer, similar to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), classifies the input image based on information extracted from previous layers. It connects to the output layer, ultimately assigning the input to a specific label.

## Diabetic Retinopathy Detection

### About the Dataset
The images consist of gaussian filtered retina scan images to detect diabetic retinopathy. The original dataset is available at APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection. These images are resized into 224x224 pixels so that they can be readily used with many pre-trained deep learning models.

All of the images are already saved into their respective folders according to the severity/stage of diabetic retinopathy using the train.csv file provided. You will find five directories with the respective images:

0 - No_DR

1 - Mild

2 - Moderate

3 - Severe

4 - Proliferate_DR


### Stages of Diabetic Retinopathy

1. **Non-Proliferative Retinopathy:** The early stage involves swelling and leakage of blood vessels. Vision may be unaffected, but close monitoring is essential.

2. **Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy:** A more serious stage where abnormal blood vessels grow, leading to potential complications like bleeding, scar tissue formation, and tractional retinal detachment.

## CNN Training

To train the CNN model for diabetic retinopathy detection:

1. **Dataset:** Utilize the provided dataset of resized retina scan images.

2. **Normalization:** Ensure pixel values are normalized between 0 and 1.

3. **Training Script:** Use the provided training script (`train_model.py` or a similar file) to train the CNN model.

4. **Inference:** After training, use the model to make predictions on new images with the provided inference script (`predict.py`).

Feel free to experiment with the model architecture, fine-tune on additional datasets, and explore deployment options for real-world applications.
